# Evolving-Ties-A-Network-Science-Approach-to-Student-Interactions-in-the-COVID-19-Crisis-

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted student interactions, prompting
this study to explore its effects across three distinct periods: before, during, and
after the crisis. Using a dataset of student interactions, we constructed networks
with NetworkX and analyzed changes in connectivity through normalized degree
distributions, correlation coefficients, and centrality measures. Findings reveal a
substantial decline in interactions during the pandemic, with reduced connectiv-
ity for both male and female students across all courses of study. Post-COVID,
there was a partial recovery in interaction levels, though not to pre-COVID stan-
dards, with variations observed by gender and academic program. Correlation
analysis indicates a stronger similarity between pre- and post-COVID networks
compared to the during-COVID period, suggesting a gradual return to earlier
social structures. Influential nodes in the networks shifted over time, reflect-
ing changes in social dynamics. This study highlights the pandemicâ€™s lasting
impact on student networks and underscores the need for targeted interventions
to support social recovery in academic settings
